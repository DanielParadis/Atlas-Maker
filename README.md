# Atlas Maker
About:
Atlas Maker was born out of my frustration. I have spent far too long splicing textures into an atlas. This utility was written by me, using stb_image to load the and save the files. Files must be square, and all files must be the same dimension. The app supports RGBA and multiple filetypes. The atlast gets exported as .PNG.

How to use:
Download and compile the code. The instructions are on screen.
